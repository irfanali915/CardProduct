# CardProduct
Sample web API application with entity framework
I pick database first approch so we need to create database and schemas first
Step 1 - Run script in order based of file prefix for creating database tables, Views, function and storeproc
         also added a test data file for inserting test data.
Step 2 - I followed test data driven MSTest and for same created CrediProducts.xls for storing
         test credit card numbers and expected result, Currently its having a VISA workbook (excel sheet),
         we can create additional workbook name must be same as Card product and data in same way as VISA sheet.
